===================
After five years without maintenance, the original Perl and SQLite based application fell into disrepair... but I 
wasn't yet ready with the next major rewrite. Therefore, this transitional Python project was thrown together to 
fill the gap in the meantime. It takes the original SQLite database (with some slight schema alterations), and 
exposes it through a dynamically-generated Django admin console.
